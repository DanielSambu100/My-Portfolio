# My-Portfolio

####A Resume-based website about who I am, what I have done, and my future road-map both professionally, academically, socially as well as other relevant spheres of life, Version 1.2022.

####Author: Daniel Sambu.

#This is my autodeveloped portfolio website describing my road-map across the fields of academia, professionalism, skills, values and beliefs, social circle, and my future trajectory. It is worth noting that the main focus herein is about my life as a software developer. You all know life is so wide, right? The building blocks of this application are HTML for the structure, vannila CSS for styling and Javascript as the future plan for page dynamism and interactivity.

####Installation: *Download the setup HERE in its zipped format. *Extract the zipped setup. *Run the Bin file and follow the steps given to facilitate successful iinstallation.

#This portflio is still at its early phase of development with more features yet to be added, therefore expect it to be dynamic, prone to frequent commits for update purposes. At its ultimate development phase, it will allow for downloading my *RESUME*.

#The application is web-based, therefore its manipulation embraces web browsers, Chrome being the preference.
